Thingagram
Introduction
What happens when you assign a project where your students make a responsive photo album site, and the theme is up to them?

It becomes entitled Thingagram.

What Is It Though
This project will be a responsive photo album within a responsive site (wrapped in an enigma).

You'll need two total grids:

A responsive grid of photos along a theme (up to you what it is!).
A responsive holy grail layout with a header, footer, and nav bar, with the photo album being the content area.
What should be in your header and footer and nav bar? Up to you, but the generic suggestion is:

The header could have a title and/or logo.
The footer could have the authorship information, including a link to the GitHub repo.
The nav bar could have a link to a separate, simple about page.
How Many Photos Should I Have?
At least 15. Otherwise it won't look that albumy.

How Many Commits Should I Have?
#app {
  commits: minmax(10, 1fr)
}
(At least 10, as many as you need.)

What Layouts Will I Need?
As is typical of this kind of project, we'll want mobile, tablet, and desktop views. Breakpoints up to you. But don't make your tablet and desktop view the same. They are different things.

Stretch Goals
Write a README outlining what your challenges and goals were, and how you overcome the first and achieved the second. Talk about the code and layout tools you used.
Make the about page the html version of the above README.
